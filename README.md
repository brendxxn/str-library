# str-library 
 The Python string library taught me that strings are far more than just sequences of charactersâ€”they are tools that can be shaped, cleaned, and formatted with a set of powerful, pre-built functions.

 
Constants like is_alpha, is_digits, and to_lower were incredibly useful for tasks that involved character validation or text filtering. If I needed to check if a character was a letter, I could use is_alpha.

 Likewise, if I needed to know if a character was a digit, is_digits gave me a predefined string of all digits from '0' to '9'. These constants saved me from having to manually define those character sets each time.

Creating my own string library was an eye-opening experience that taught me a great deal about both string manipulation and the underlying principles of programming.From memory management to performance optimization, edge case handling, and algorithm design, I gained valuable skills in low-level programming concepts that I often take for granted when using high-level language functions.

Methods Used - is_alpha, is_digit, for loop, if statement, return, print function, to_upper, to_lower
